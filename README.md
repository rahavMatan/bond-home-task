## Usage:

`docker-compose up` - to run a mongo DB docker.

`npm run dev` - Run development server.


## Notes:
This is far from a production ready project. Still many things to add such as :
Better error handling
Logging
Metrics
secrets and env files
TESTS!
CI/CD pipelines
Swagger
More efficient DB Indexes
DB Migrations tools
